# The Barrista

The barrista is a tool to enjoy [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git)
particularly well from Python. It exposes the entire library functionality
to Python, and you can create, modify, train, load and save 'caffe' networks
conveniently through one API. For more information,
see the dedicated [homepage & documentation](https://classner.github.io/barrista).

## CI status

The master branch is always stable, with all tests passing. Development is
going on on the unstable branch, and you can see the current build status
here:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/classner/barrista.svg?branch=unstable)](https://travis-ci.org/classner/barrista) unstable branch build status, Python 2 (Python 3 is deactivated for the moment, because of an instability with caffe on Python 3).
